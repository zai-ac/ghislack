# Issues with GitHub Integration for Slack
## About this fork

This was forked from the [upstream](https://github.com/integrations/slack) after they disabled Issues without warning; at least one of my filed Issues has not been fixed, and subsequent similar bugs have occurred, prompting this repository's creation.

Please do not hesitate to use Draft Pull Requests for opening similar discussions within this repository; however, do not do this with the upstream, as you will probably get blocked by the administration, who are sick of people like me and have been gradually making me feel unwelcome on this website.
